PERSONAL PORTFOLIO   ||   --- https://sbrenz.github.io ---

This is my first project, and it's my portfolio webpage.

 I wanted to give the site a minimal and elegant style using HTML and CSS,
adding some functionality with JavaScript, two carousels on the home page.
The Portofolio page is disabled because I don't have any other projects yet.
The Info page is very simple, there is a photo and 2 paragraphs.
Then there is the Contacts page which has a simple form (it works).
The footer contains two social icons, linked to my github and my linkedin.

Thanks for reading !!
